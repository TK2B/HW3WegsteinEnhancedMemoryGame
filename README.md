!!!!! For evaluating pick AnotherRecyclebind         !!!!



- OnLoad :  SLIDER to select size of the Grid (Level)
            Enter Your Name and Press Play
            
-GAME : Made a CustomButtonClass which can hold/store some additional data 
      : All data is stored in LIST  (i gave them all IDs if you neee acceess to something specific)
      : View is in the Recycler in a Item.xml 
      : item.xml stores a CustomButtonClass 
      
      
      
       NOTE Its not possible to implement the Game with a MVVM because the listners have to be bind to the Recycle Item so the Game Logic hast to be in the VIEW of the Acitvity 
       to meet the requirements i implemented it to the point you can go
