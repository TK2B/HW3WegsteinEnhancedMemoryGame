#Homework 2: MemoryGame App
In this assignment you will develop a MemoryGame that will let the user play memory on his/her phone. We will start with 8 cards displayed on the screen, all cards face down. The user picks on card, then another. If both cards show the same symbol/picture, the pair is removed and the user continues to turn other cards. If the two cards turned don’t show the same symbol/picture, both cards are turned after a few seconds. The app will track the number of flips/turns of cards and display that number on the bottom of the screen.
The game ends when there are no more cards to flip/turn.
The following picture shows a sample screen of the game. Obviously, one cannot play the game with an odd number of cards.
Assignment Description:
Starting-point: You might be able to reuse some of the code from your first assignment AdvancedNumGuessGame as your starting point. Enhance this app by adding the required functionality as described above.
The grid for your buttons will depend on the number of buttons/cards displayed. You might already build in the flexibility to enhance your screen to more buttons/cards. We suggest you work with TableLayouts to arrange the buttons accordingly. We used emojis as pictures (but your free to use ImageButtons for your UI)
Constraints: Again, we’ll leave things very open-ended. I’ll leave it up to you to design the screen and make it look nice.
• Name your app “HW2<Lastname>MemoryGame” (so if I were to submit a solution, I’d call my app HW2xxxxhMemoryGame). Along with your app, please turn in a file named
   
CMIS435
README.txt that contains your name and email address along with the name of your app and a very brief description of it, along with any special instructions that the user might need to know in order to use it properly (if there are any). For example:
Joe Student jstudent@siue.edu
MemoryGame - This app shows two numbers on the screen and asks
the user to pick the larger number. Perfect for talented students! Note: Runs best on big Android tablets because of 1000dp font choice.
Suggestions:
Again, bear in mind that these assignments, as well as this class in general, are meant to be low- stress and fun. Feel free to make an app as simple or as complex as you like, relative to your familiarity level and time constraints. In case you run into major obstacles, always feel free to contact Josh or myself.
Turn-in and Grading:
Once done, please upload your code (preferably the zip-file extracted from Android Studio) into Blackboard/OLAT. After programs are turned in, you will be asked to peer-evaluate another student's submission. Details will be provided in class.
Your submission will be graded quickly by simply running it and evaluating its functionality. It does not need to be perfect or bug-free to receive credit. Your code will not be graded on style, but we still encourage you to follow good overall coding style for your own sake.
